#Week 3 entry

#Things are still going smoothly, however, understanding what AJAX actually is had a rocky start.
#My partner this week was Christopher L. and he was really easy to work with. He helped me solve the nice-array codewars problem and thank goodness for that because I was having a difficult time figuring out how to put a loop within a loop while separating the iterations through the string inputs.
#Need to catch up on the reading though so I'm going to do that now!
