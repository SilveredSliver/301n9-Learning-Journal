#Week 5 entry

#I think this week was Node (writing from a future perspective), hard to remember with all that we've been learning.
#Don't really have an issue with understanding it as far as I can remember, managed to copy down a cheatsheet of commands too. Just one of those things that if you do more, you'll get it under your belt in no time. The logic is pretty straightforward, just need to remember to install all those packages.
