#This first week has been a quick taste of what the next weeks up until the 27th of January will feel like in ever increasing difficulty and frustration, I imagine in my uneducated forecast. Converting to JQuery is a transition that needs work for me, obviously, but I know it's much better than the initial way we coded in 201. I can already see the differences and html should clear up a lot more. It's just a matter of linking all the files together in order to render objects through constructor functions to the DOM. Fortunately, it's not so hard to ask questions the first time, it's just a matter of having ask again and again and again that I feel guilty about, but that's just a personal bump in the road that I need to stop caring about and stomp on it until it smooths over. Here's hoping that I'll retain as much as possible over the next few weeks.
